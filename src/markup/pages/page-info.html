<p>I know you are expecting me to tell you how passionate I am about photography here, and don't get me wrong, taking pictures of people and their emotional connections to one another makes me weepy just thinking about it. However,&nbsp;if we are going to be friends, you should probably know a little more about me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm obsessed with my daughters, more than a parent should be. I even had to create their&nbsp;own instagram so my feed wouldn't be completely swallowed up by pictures of them.&nbsp;If you saw the number of pictures I have of them from their small amount of time on Earth, you'd be embarrassed for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm really into sea otters. I saw one up close and personal in the wild on a kayaking trip and almost fell into the water with excitement. You could probably call it an obsession.</p>

<p>I consider marrying my husband, Matt&nbsp;the #1 best decision of my whole life. Our arguments range from the best way to format our household budgeting documents to what girl should win the Bachelor. Also, he does the dishes. Let me just repeat that- He. Does. The. Dishes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I will crawl into the bushes for a great shot, but I will not camp for any amount of money. Even s'mores can't save camping, and s'mores are my 4th favorite dessert.</p>

<p>My greatest fear in life is&nbsp;falling to my death in an elevator. The Tower of Terror exists just to ruin my Disneyland experience.</p>

<p>I ran myself over with my own car when I was 20. My own car, people. You'll have to call me for the&nbsp;details. It's just too&nbsp;embarrassing&nbsp;to write down.</p>

<p>I consider false eyelashes the greatest gift to womankind. Ever. I wear them about once a lifetime now that I'm a mom, but when I do, I feel like a boss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm addicted to travel. I try to get out of the city once a month (I even made a&nbsp;<a href="https://cristinmorephotography.com/category/travel-inspiration/">blog series about my travels</a>) with a yearly trip overseas. People tried to tell me it would stop when we had kids, but we are still going strong.</p>

<p>My husband, our daughters and I all lived in a 500 sq. ft apartment for years in the heart of San Francisco. We finally bought a house in Marin and all we could talk about the entire time we were moving was how we now had the luxury of two whole bathrooms. For anyone with a potty-training toddler, you know what's up.&nbsp;</p>
